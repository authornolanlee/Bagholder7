You can load the page by visiting [github.io](https://nickaustinlee.github.io/Bagholder7/). 

If you want to change the portfolio into your own Bagholder 7 selection, here is how you do it:

1. Clone this repo or download the HTML file.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build steps needed).
3. Update the `portfolioDataNDJSON` block in the HTML to match your investment timeline.

## ðŸ“Ž Data Format (NDJSON)

Note: You can change allocations on any date, but I suggest checking the last trading day's value and ensuring the dollar value is preserved for your new allocation.

```json
{"Tickers": ["MSTR", "SAVA", "QBTS"], "Proportions": [0.25, 0.25, 0.5], "Dollars": 1000, "Date": "2025-01-01"}
